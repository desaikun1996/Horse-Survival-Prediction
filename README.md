# Horse Survival Prediction
Given a dataset containing all the attributes of a horse(its age and all the other medical conditions), we predict the chances of survival of a horse. The project contains step-wise methods to preprocess the data using techniques like encoding, null value handling, followed by making the prediction using algorithms like Decision Tree Classifier and Random Forest Classifier.
